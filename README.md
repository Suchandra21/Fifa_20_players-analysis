# Hotel_booking_analysis

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform EDA on a hotel booking dataset and derive meaningful conclusions about booking patterns, customer demographics, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
We’ll be working with a dataset containing hotel reservation details. It includes information from both a city hotel and a resort hotel. Here are some key features in the dataset:

hotel: Name of the hotel (City or Resort)

arrival_date_year: Year of arrival

arrival_date_month: Month of arrival

arrival_date_week_number:Week number of arrival

arrival_date_day_of_month:date of the day of the month of arrival

stays_in_weekend_nights:Number of days stayed in the weekend nights

stays_in_week_nights:Number of days stayed in the week nights

adults:Number of adults

children:Number of children

babies:Number of babies

meal:Names of the meals served in acronyms

 total_special_requests:Total number of special requests made by the customers

 reservation status:Status of the reservation

 reservation_status_date:Date when the status of the reservation was checked

## Analysis
The analysis done is divided into:
1)Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types. 
2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of ratings, genres, and other features.
3)Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data.

## Conclusions
Various important data patterns were extracted.Changes to be made for the betterment are provided which can lead to an improvement.
